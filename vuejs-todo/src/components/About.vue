    <h3>What is this about?</h3>
    <h4>This website is about one thing and that is productivity!</h4>
    <p>I created this for two reasons:</p>
    <p><b>1)</b> I wanted to learn JavaScript. Working on a project is one of the best ways how to get better knowledge and some experience as well.</p>
    <p><b>2)</b> I wanted to create a tool that would help you and me focus on our tasks and make us spend our time well.</p>
    <p>So explore this site and then get back to work!</p>
